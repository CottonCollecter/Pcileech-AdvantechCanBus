ðŸš€ Project: Pcileech-AdvantechCanBus

ðŸ”Ž Overview
This project provides an FPGA-based DMA firmware that mimics a CanBus card.
It integrates with the Pcileech research tool, appearing as a standard device

âš¡ Key Features

Identifies as a AdvantechCanBus card.
Stealth integration with the Pcileech framework.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This release is intended for:

Researchers exploring DMA and USB3 stealth techniques.
For research and learning purposes only â€” not intended for misuse.
